## Setup Instructions
Aside from the basic [Flutter setup instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and a device or emulator to run the application on, there are no additional setup instructions required.
## Assumptions
The app was built under the following assumptions: 
- Time was of the essence, and only 5 hours of coding time would be allowed. This means that finer touches and other "non-essential" features, such as localization support or animations, would not be implemented.
- The application should be coded such that the architecture should emphasize modularity and flexibility while remaining functional
- Functionality, architecture, and readability of the app would be paramount. How aesthetically pleasing the UI was irrelevant as long as the UX made common sense
